## JWT and GCP
 I spent a good amount of time learning about JWT (JSON Web Token) and Google Console Project both of which are super important when it comes to authentication and working with APIs. I started off with JWT, which is basically a way to securely pass information between different systems. What’s cool about it is that it’s stateless, meaning the server doesn’t have to remember anything about a user’s session. Instead, all the necessary data is stored inside the token itself. A JWT is made up of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature. The header contains information about the algorithm used, the payload holds the actual data (like user ID or permissions), and the signature ensures that the token hasn’t been tampered with.  

One thing I found interesting is that while JWTs are encoded, they’re not encrypted, which means you shouldn’t store sensitive data inside them. They’re mostly used for authentication, like when a user logs in and gets a token that proves who they are. A common example is OAuth 2.0 authentication, which is what allows people to sign into websites using Google, Facebook, or other third-party accounts. To get hands-on experience, I played around with jwt.io, generating and verifying tokens to understand how they work. Seeing how the different parts of a JWT fit together made things much clearer.  

After getting a good grasp of JWT, I moved on to Google Console Project. This is basically Google’s platform for managing cloud services and APIs. The first step was setting up a new project, which involved creating an account, navigating through the dashboard, and enabling the services I needed. I looked into different APIs like Google OAuth, Maps API, and Firebase, which are widely used in web and mobile apps. Since security is a big part of working with APIs, I also learned about the different ways to authenticate API requests: API keys, OAuth Client ID, and Service Accounts.  

API keys are the simplest to use, but they need to be protected because anyone who gets access to them can make requests on your behalf. OAuth Client ID, on the other hand, is used when you want users to log in with their Google accounts. This is the authentication method you usually see when websites offer a “Sign in with Google” button. Service Accounts are different because they’re meant for server-to-server communication rather than user authentication.  
  
Overall, it was a really productive learning session. JWT is super useful for authentication, and knowing how to use it properly will definitely come in handy for future projects. Meanwhile, getting familiar with Google Console Project opened up a lot of possibilities for integrating Google’s services into applications. Moving forward, I plan to implement JWT-based authentication in a real project and explore more advanced Google services like Cloud Storage, Firebase Authentication, and Google Drive API integration. There’s still a lot to learn, but I feel much more comfortable with these tools now, and I’m excited to apply this knowledge in real-world applications.
