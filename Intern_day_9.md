## programming language
### programming language is an interface for the user to communicate with the computer the compiler translates the human readable code in to the machine language and it works based on the command was given and do the tasks as assigned .Every language has the own syntax and semantics we have to follow its rules to execute an code in the computer .
### in javascript i have learned concepts of array in the i had learned about many concepts and the operation of the array and how it make the code easier for the programmer.
- Length() this operation in array is used to calculate the array length
- Manipulating the element in the array
- Finding the index no of the element in the array calling the element using its index number
- Creating an array inside an array
- Adding more elements in an existing array it add new elements only after the existing elements in the array
- Storing the length of an array in an variable
- Adding new elements in the beginning of an existing array using unshift()
- To delete the last item in the array using pop()
- to store the removed item in an array as a variable
- to remove the first item in the array using shift()
- we can delete the item directly in the array if we know the index_no of an item
- in this command second argument (index,2) says how many items to be removed
- TO access every item in the array using for and of
- if we call like this it will show values outside the values and as an separate values
- double an number inside the array using map()
