## Loops
- We do not use loop in any part of our program because of its repitative nature if we did not gave the end point to it it will lead in to the cluster of the program and make us lose more storage in the cloud and make losses in both time and resource.Improper use of loops without defining an endpoint can lead to infinite iterations, consuming excessive memory and processing power. This can result in performance issues, increased resource usage, and unnecessary storage costs, making it crucial to manage loops effectively to optimize both time and computational resources.
## For loop
-  A for loop is one of the most commonly used loops in programming, especially when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It consists of three main components: initialization, condition, and increment or decrement. The initialization step sets up a control variable, the condition determines how long the loop will continue executing, and the increment or decrement step updates the control variable after each iteration. This loop is ideal for iterating through arrays, performing calculations, or executing a block of code a specific number of times. Since the loop control variable is explicitly defined, it ensures a predictable and structured execution, making it a preferred choice for scenarios where iteration limits are clear.
## while loop
-  while loop is used when the number of iterations is not predetermined, executing continuously as long as a specified condition remains true. Unlike a for loop, a while loop does not require an explicit initialization or update step; it only relies on the condition. This makes while loops useful for cases where iterations depend on user input, sensor data, or real-time system conditions. However, while loops must be carefully managed to prevent infinite execution, as failing to update the condition properly can cause the loop to run indefinitely, leading to performance degradation and system crashes. To avoid such issues, developers should ensure that conditions are updated within the loop and that there is a clear exit strategy.
