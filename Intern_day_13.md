## Backend_server
- creating an backend server using Express.js
- The main purspose of the server is to record the attendance of a person with respectives fields.
- Here i am using an opensource API called bruno to access the server.
- The result we get from the server is to give an request to the server through the API called bruno
  and getting the response for the route we gave in the resquest.
- It stores the person's complete record of his presence in the server with uqique id which makes easier to get from the server.
- WE are running this server in  the localhost 3000,We have to create an port to instruct the server where to run the command.
## HTML
- Hypertext markup language,It uses to format an web page and structure an web page.
- we can use it to create an webpage based on the requirements.
- we will use several tags here to mention the particular fields we an trying to create in th page.
- And we will use unique attributes to the tags it helps us to identify the particular tag,Because we use same tag more time in the web page.
## CSS
- Cascading style sheet it uses to style the page texts and structure we have created in the html.
 **It has three types of css**
- Inline 
- Internal
- External
- Inline css is allows us to style the font in the html within th ehtml tag command
- Internal css is creating an separate style tag within the html file and styling inside that tags for the other tags.
- External css is creating an separate css file for styling and link that file in the html file using the tag called <link>,it aloows us to style the tags using their unique attribute.
