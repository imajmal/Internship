## Problem solving
- I have learned about how and what are all the measures we need to follow if we are going to solve an problem.
- And to think what are the possible ways to solve this problem and after found that need to think which one is the faster one to solve and more efficient.

## Proposition Logic:

- Proposition logic deals with statements that can be either true  or false.
- Uses logical operators

### 1. Mathematical Representation of Logical Operators
#### **Conjunction (AND, ∧)**
- Conjunction represents the logical **"AND"**.
- P ∧ Q is **true** if both P and Q are **true**.  
- P ∧ Q is **false** if P is **true** and Q is **false**.  
- P ∧ Q is **false** if P is **false** and Q is **true**.  
- P ∧ Q is **false** if both P and Q are **false**.  

#### **Disjunction (OR, ∨)**
- Disjunction represents the logical **"OR"**.
- P ∨ Q is **true** if both P and Q are **true**.  
- P ∨ Q is **true** if P is **true** and Q is **false**.  
- P ∨ Q is **true** if P is **false** and Q is **true**.  
- P ∨ Q is **false** if both P and Q are **false**.  

#### **Implication (Conditional, →)**
- Implication represents a **conditional statement**.
- Example : "If you get an A in maths , I will buy you an iphone".
- P → Q is **true** if both P and Q are **true**.  
- P → Q is **false** if P is **true** and Q is **false**.  
- P → Q is **true** if P is **false** and Q is **true**.  
- P → Q is **true** if both P and Q are **false**.  

#### **Biconditional (↔, "if and only if")**
- Biconditional means **"P if and only if Q"**.
- Example: "If and only if you get an A in maths, I will buy you an iphone"
- P ↔ Q is **true** if both P and Q are **true**.  
- P ↔ Q is **false** if P is **true** and Q is **false**.  
- P ↔ Q is **false** if P is **false** and Q is **true**.  
- P ↔ Q is **true** if both P and Q are **false**.

## Mentor seesion 
- I was given to solve some problems which focuses on the concepts of Loops,Array,Factorial and reverse string.
- And i get to about the surfboards and my mentor explains me about his role in the surfboard he is working in the terminal team.
- Then i stared solving the problems  was given tome to solve.
