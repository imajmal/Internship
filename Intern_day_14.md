## Functions
### Functions in the programming language are an block of code which is used to store an particular operation it only needs to be executed when it is needed by the user,It only works on the program only it is called by the user in the program if its not called by user it wont do anything in the program even it exist in the code.
### Return type  function it will return the value of the particular datatype and the function need to be create using the datatype keywork it differs for every programming language in java we have to mention the datatype as a keyword to create the function and then it returns the particular datatype value,In Java script no need to use an datatype as an keyword to create an function.
## Classes
### Class are an blue print of the program  we can create the required fields for th program inside an class .We create the fields within the class with no data in the fields but we can access and fill the data inside the fields by using objects.
## Object is instance of the class it is an key to access the fields within the class and it can access the class from the outside of the class inside of the main function We can create multiple instances for an single class and can fill multiple values for the fields inside the class using different instances and Every time an object is created it initializes the constructor of the class.
## Constructor
### It is an inbuilt function of the class it also has the classes name defaultly it works when an object is created for the class. Parameterized constructor it uses to pass the data from the outside using the object and it fills the data within th field.In the main function we can call the particular data from many data we filled through many object by calling with its object name.field name.
## Backend server
### I have been creating an backend server in java script using experss.js framework.
- This server is used for maintaing the attendance of an person.
- It stores the data of his Name,Age,Id and the total no.of.days the office was operational and how many days he is present and how many days he is absent,If he took an leave it holds the reson for the leave on the particular date .
- After creating the local server i'm using an array to hold all the data of the user.
- I programmed the function to do all this operation inside it whenever it called stores that data and information of that function into an array.
- Here for now i have used two methods POST and GEt.
- POST is used to Store an value or resource in to the array or database if we connected one,In bruno API tester we call it by Running its localhost and using this method we stores value in the array.
-GEt method is used to give an request for an particular data from the server and it bring that request to an server and returns the response for the request we have given.
- Both methods are using separate route to complete their task and using the route only we can call then or assign them the task through the API.
