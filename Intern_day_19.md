## ORM Object Relational Model

### TypeORM is a popular ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript applications, particularly in Node.js environments. It provides a way to interact with databases using an intuitive, object-oriented approach. With TypeORM, developers can define entities (database tables) as TypeScript classes, making it easier to manage relationships, queries, and migrations efficiently.

### Among the various ORM libraries available, TypeORM is one of the most popular choices for JavaScript and TypeScript applications, especially in the Node.js ecosystem. It is designed to work seamlessly with TypeScript, allowing developers to define their database structure using classes and decorators,TypeORM supports various relational databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB, and SQL Server, making it a flexible choice for different projects. It provides a powerful set of features such as automatic migrations, relationship management, and query building, which simplify database handling.

### In TypeORM, database tables are represented as entities (TypeScript classes). Each entity corresponds to a table in the database, and each property in the class represents a column in that table. This allows developers to define and interact with their database schema using an object-oriented approach.

### TypeORM makes working with databases in Node.js applications much simpler and more efficient. It eliminates the complexity of raw SQL queries and brings the power of object-oriented programming to database management.
